        <h2 class="devInfo">About the Creators</h2>
        <p>If you have come to learn about the awesome creators you are in the right place. This app was designed for anybody who has a passion for alcohol no matter where they are. 
            The thought process behind our application may not be complex to you, but building this as a first project has come to be an experience that holds value. There are three creators who 
            have put an immense amount of work into this application; Grant Willis, Cole Kasabian, and Jose Carrasco. All three of us have spent time working on different parts of the application
            all with great importance. As new developers we would love any constructive feedback that anyone is willing to share. We have included our contact information <a href="#">below</a>, feel 
            free to reach out and let us know what you think.</p>
        <h4>Thank you for reading, Happy Brewer Me!</h4>
